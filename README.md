This program is an excellent system that satisfies all of the client's criteria. The program was created in Jupyter Notebook with Python 3. As a result, Jupyter Notebook may be used to run the application. The program consists of two modules: the backend, which connects to and retrieves data from the utilized database, and the front end, which serves as a link between them.
The program employs a mongo database instead of a relational or structured query language-based database since it offers more benefits in the following areas:
	It is developer-friendly, 
	It has the ability to handle massive amounts of data quickly
	It makes it simple to alter the schema and its fields
	It makes the most of the cloud as well
The project is a straightforward application that aims to give the user access to data that satisfies specified criteria. In other words, the user will only be able to see the data he wants to see because the data is filtered depending on the inputs he sends to the server.
The data on the table are displayed when the user selects a radio button in the simple graphic below, which represents the window used to filter data.
 

Additionally, there are graphs and geocharts at the bottom of the page that provide data for the specified animal on the database. 
This is crucial since users may only check the animals, they need to know rather than scrolling through a table with all the data from the database. The table only displays the animals that belong to the category chosen above.
Additionally, there are geo charts, which are web maps that display the location of the business and some information about the chosen animal. This map provides a direction, making it crucial for all users who want to find an animal's position. 
A visual depiction of the chosen data is shown as the last component. This is significant since it is simple to understand and allows one to immediately form an impression of the chosen data. 
Steps taken
1. The server has all necessary elements, thus installation was not necessary.
Installation requirements for new users include Jupyter Notebook and the Mongo database.
2. The connection file established a link to the database and sped up the data retrieval. The new file must be connected to the database using this fie.
3. In addition, I created the software for creating charts, maps, and data tables.
The problem of resolving errors was one of my project's biggest problems. I haven't discovered a method for capturing exceptions the same way other languages do. When presenting the graphs, it is difficult to show any errors on the screen so that repair is simple.
